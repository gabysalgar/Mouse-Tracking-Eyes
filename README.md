# Mouse-Tracking Eyes

## Description
A JavaScript animation that displays a pair of moving eyes by tracking mouse cursor positions and movements using DOM manipulation to dynamically style elements within the CSS grid. More specifically, the running code employs event listeners to access DOM elements using CSS-style selectors or relationship properties (i.e., class name `ball`), and then implements programatic functionality by manipulating the element's CSS styling to send `mousemove` events to the `div` element when the mouse cursor moves over the respective element.

## Installation
_**NOTE:** In order to run the "Mouse-Tracking Eyes" animation, you must download/copy the 3 required files (`eyes.js`, `index.html`, and `styles.css`) & store all the files in the same local directory on your machine._
There are two ways to copy the repository files to your local system:
* Download the repository as a zip file to your local machine:  
  * Navigate to the GitHub repository's main page and click the green _'Code'_ button on the right side. 
  * In the menu pop-up, click _'Download ZIP'_. 
* Fork & Clone the GitHub repository to create a local copy:
  * Navigate to the GitHub repository's main page and click the green _'Code'_ button on the right side. In the menu pop-up under **'Clone'**, select your clone type (`HTTPS`, `SSH`, or `GitHub CLI`), and then click the button to copy the URL.
  * Open your system's command-line system (**Terminal** for Mac users). Use the `cd` command to navigate to the system location where you want the cloned repository to exist. In the command line, type `git clone [url]` with the copied URL to finish cloning the repository to your local system.

Once the zip file or cloned repository is copied onto your local system, locate and open the local directory. 

Open your web browser (Google Chrome is recommended), and drag and drop the `index.html` file into your browser window to run the live animation (or, right-click the _'index.html'_ file and select your browser from the _'Open With'_ command).
